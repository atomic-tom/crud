A very rudimentary example of CRUD, a to-do list webapp

!! Presupposes php5, php-mysqlind, apache, and mysql are pre-installed via yum or aptitude
!!
!! To run setup.sh, your user should be a sudoer
!!
!! You must have a SQL user capable of creating a database and table. Use that username
!! as the first argument when running setup.sh . If the user you are logged-in as is the
!! same user, you do not need to specify the username as an argument.
!!
!! setup.sh will explicitly tell you to enter your SQL user's password. Any other requests
!! for passwords should be assumed to be for sudoing
!!
!! We assume that we can add a DirectoryIndex directive in .htaccess that apache will
!! respect. This may not be the case depending on your set-up. If so, you will need
!! to access the application @ http://localhost/crud/index.php


To install:

-- Extract all files into your directory of choice
-- chmod +x setup.sh
-- ./setup.sh $SQL_USER
